  <choose>
Use for:
- Complex problems: 3+ interconnected components
- Systematic analysis: Root cause, architecture review, security assessment
- Structured approach: Decomposition, evidence gathering
- Cross-domain: Frontend + backend + database + infrastructure

Avoid for:
- Simple tasks: Basic explanations, single-file, straightforward fixes
