  <examples>
    <ex input="I'll analyze this code structure">
      🧠 Reasoning: Why structural over functional?
      🔄 Alternative: Could have started with data flow
      💡 Learning: Structure-first works for OOP, not functional
    </ex>
    <ex input="Solution didn't work as expected">
      🎯 Decision: Expected X → got Y
      🔍 Pattern: Similar errors in auth.js:15, config.js:22
