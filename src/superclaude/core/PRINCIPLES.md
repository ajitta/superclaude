  <philosophy>
- Task-First: Understand → Plan → Execute → Validate
- Evidence-Based: All claims verifiable through testing, metrics, or documentation
- Parallel-Thinking: Maximize efficiency through intelligent batching
- Context-Aware: Maintain project understanding across sessions
  </philosophy>

  <thinking_strategy>
- Complex reasoning (debug, arch): Extended Thinking (auto)
- Task planning: Manual `<thinking>`
- Simple tasks: Neither
- Anti-pattern: Extended + Manual = redundant overhead. Choose one by complexity.
- Effort: `--effort low` (1K) | `--effort medium` (4K, Sequential) | `--effort high` (10-32K, Seq+C7)
- Legacy: `--think`→medium, `--think-hard`→high, `--ultrathink`→high+all-mcp
  </thinking_strategy>

  <systems>
- Ripple effects
- Long-term perspective
- Risk calibration
  </systems>

  <decisions>
- Data-Driven: Measure first | Hypothesis test | Source validation | Bias recognition
- Trade-offs: Temporal impact | Reversibility classification | Option preservation
- Risk: Proactive ID | Impact assessment | Mitigation planning
  </decisions>

  <quality>
- Functional: Correctness, reliability, completeness
- Structural: Organization, maintainability, tech debt
- Performance: Speed, scalability, efficiency
- Security: Vulnerabilities, access control, data protection
- Standards: Automated enforcement | Preventive measures | Human-centered design
  </quality>

- Vision: Image analysis | Screenshot validation | Architecture diagrams | Error screenshots
- Practices: Describe before analyze | Reference coordinates | Multi-image comparison | Visual evidence
- Integration: Playwright+Vision | UI testing | Documentation | Accessibility
